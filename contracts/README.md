# API contracts

Contract package revision: 0.14. Observations accept wire revisions 0.11 and
0.12; configuration and control messages remain at 0.11.

The two OpenAPI 3.1 documents define the business and collector HTTP
surfaces. `schemas.json` is the shared JSON Schema 2020-12 definition set.
`operation-map.json` lists all 71 operations: 58 business and 13 collector.
`examples.json`, `wire-examples.json`, and `hn-time-wire-examples.json`
contain fictional fixtures, including intentionally invalid wire cases.

An article at revision 0.12 requires nullable `submitted_at`. The submitted
time basis is limited to `global-hn`, with publication and update times null
and unknown source order. Revision 0.11 retains its original field set.
Frozen observation bytes and their hashes must never be rewritten.

These files describe requests and responses. They do not provide
authentication, authorization, persistence, or source admission. Clients and
the service must still verify those rules at runtime.
